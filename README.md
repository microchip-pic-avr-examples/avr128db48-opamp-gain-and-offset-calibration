# AVR128DB48 Gain and Offset Calibration of the Analog Signal Conditioning (OPAMP) Peripheral

A new feature introduced in the AVRÂ® DB MCU is the Analog Signal Conditioning (OPAMP) peripheral. The OPAMP peripheral can be configured as a PGA, in this example the internal DAC and ADC are used to calibrate gain and offset for the PGA. For more information on the calibration procedure, see the application note.
